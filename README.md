# Calculator – Manual vs Code-Based (ASP.NET Web Forms)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **difference between Manual (Toolbox-based)** and **Code-Based** development in **ASP.NET Web Forms (.NET Framework)**.

It is a beginner-level learning project created to understand how UI controls and backend logic work when:

* Controls are added manually using Visual Studio Toolbox
* Controls and logic are written completely using code

---

## 🎯 Objective

* Understand ASP.NET Web Forms basics
* Learn the difference between **Drag & Drop UI** and **Code-Written UI**
* Improve backend logic understanding using C#
* Build confidence for real-world web development

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* ASP.NET Web Forms (.NET Framework)
* C#
* Visual Studio
* IIS Express
